# How to run?

The project is simple to run, just let Gradle work and then run the project.

# About the project

The project uses MVVM in its architecture, coded 100% in Kotlin and uses some libraries such as Navigation, Coroutines, Koin, Retrofit and among other important libraries.

# Difficulties:

As a developer I had difficulties in creating the scale screen, as I was not familiar with Canvas, Paint and other tools to create drawings.

I hope you like the code, I did it with a lot of dedication for this test, have fun!
